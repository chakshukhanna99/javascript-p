Introduction to programming 
computer is dumb only understand binary
to make computer understad our language 
we need to code
ecmascript is a standard on which javascript is based on 
3 types of variables in javascript
var let and const 
var : global scope and can be redeclared reinitialize 
let can be updated n\but not redaclared
const can neither be redeclare nor be updated
const must be initialize during declaration unlike var or let

different types of data types
primitive and objects
primitive : null number undefined string symbol bigint
objects: an object in a javascript can be created as follows 
const chakshu {
    name: "chakshu",
    age:18
}
let a = 45;
let b = "hello";
let c = null;
let d = true;
let e = BigInt("567")+BigInt("3");
let f = Symbol("I am a nice symbol")
let g = undefined;
console.log(a,b,c,d,e,f,g)
console.log(typeof d);
const item = {
  "harry":true,
  "shubh":false,
  "lovish":69,
  "Rohan":undefined,
}
console.log(item["lovish"])

NEXT TOPIC STRINGS
  let name ="harry"
  name.length

  to use bot sungle quote and double quote inside our string we are going to use backtics

  let name = `harry`
  let sentence = `my name is "harry'`

  string interpolation
  let a = 'This is${name}`
  String properties and methods 

  let name = "harry"
  name.length
  name.toUpperCase()
  name.toLowerCase()
  name.slice(2,4);   rr 
  name.slice(2)   rry
  let name = "Harry Bhai"
  name.replace("Bhai","Bhau")


let name1 ="harry"
let name2 = "Namen"
let name3 = name1.concat(name2,"yes")
let name1 ="harry"
let name2 = "Naman"
let name3 = name1.concat(name2,"yes")
console.log(name3);

let name="harry "
let newname=name.trim();
console.log(newname)
  trim removes whitespaces
console.log(name[0])


let fruit = "Bana\"na"
console.log(fruit)

in js type of arr is object 
and objects are mutable can change while strings are not


WE CAN ADD A NEW VALUE WE CAN UPDATE THE VALUE OF ARRAY OR ORIGNAL ARRAY UNLIKE SREINGS

if we do document.get element by class name it will return a collection of html objects if we want to perform any operation on it we need to convert it to array first for whic we use array from 

map just like for each but make a new array filter just filter out using the required condition & make a new array and reduce give a value reduce take valuesline wise for eg in array of 12345 first add 1 and 2 then add that to 3
